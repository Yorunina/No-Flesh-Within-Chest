#IMPORTANT NOTICE:
#THIS IS ONLY THE COMMON CONFIG. It does not contain all the values adjustable for Create Ore Excavation
#The settings have been moved to createoreexcavation-server.toml
#That file is PER WORLD, meaning you have to go into 'saves/<world name>/serverconfig' to adjust it. Those changes will then only apply for THAT WORLD.
#You can then take that config file and put it in the 'defaultconfigs' folder to make it apply automatically to all NEW worlds you generate FROM THERE ON.
#This may appear confusing to many of you, but it is a new sensible way to handle configuration, because the server configuration is synced when playing multiplayer.
